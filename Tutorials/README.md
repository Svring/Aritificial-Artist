For now the best choice to run stable diffusion is google colab, which cost about 12$ a month with google drive.

Reasonably thinking, if you couldn't afford the price to use colab, then it's very likely that you don't have the decent device to support the computing process of diffusion models, so just face the fact that the price must be paid somehow.

Midjourney is only available in Discord, and it cost 10$ a month to get limited access to its model, not much space to operate.
